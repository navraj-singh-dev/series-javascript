// DOM (Document Object Model)
    // Html file is called a document in browser and
    // its individual tags and elements are called nodes and can be,
    // considered as javascript objects.
    // Browser makes a tree like structure for this html elements and tags
    // and this document can be completely manipulated using JavaScript.

// Window Object
    // 1. A Browser's entire opened window is called a window object.
    //    A single window of a browser can have multiple tabs opened.
    // 2. Every single tab opened in browser's window has its own independent window object
    //    and each tab has its own webpage (HTML Document) and its own independant DOM.
    // 3. This DOM of a tab can be completely manipulated by javascript,
    //    but to do this javascript needs help of that tab's window object.
    // 4. Window is a global variable.
    // 5. Window provide a lot of funtions and tools which can be
    //    used by javascript.


// we can access DOM using "document" keyword. 
document.querySelector()

// we can access window object of a opened tab using "window" keyword.
window.scrollX()
