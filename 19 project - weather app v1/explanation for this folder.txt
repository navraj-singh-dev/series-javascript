What I did/achieved here in this folder :
    1. i made a project using all the knowledge of previous folders.
    2. it is a simple weather app that can fetch data from a api and show it on screen.
    3. interface :
        1. user add its city
        2. user clicks button to enter informatin
        3. city name goes to backend server and using weather api we fetch the data
        4. data is converted into json and then weather information is shown on screen.

    4. my project implements fetch(), async, await, json(), addEventListener(),
       getElementById(), Higher Order Functions.
