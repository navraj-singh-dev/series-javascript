What I did/achieved here in this folder :
    1. createElement("tag_name")
    2. appendChild("child_element)

i created a button which listens for a click event
and then after a click create a new "li" from thin air
and append it as a child to the container div.

i learned how to dynamically create new elements using javascript.
