What I did/achieved here in this folder :

    script.js:
    1. arrow function's : syntax, paramters + arguments
       and storing it in a variable.

    script_2.js:
    1. differences between "normal" and "arrow" functions
        - cant use hoisting in arrow.
        - cant use "this" in arrow.
        - cant use "argument" keyword in arrow.
