What I did/achieved here in this folder :

    1. used getElementsByClassName("class_name_here").

         getElementsByClassName give us a HTMLCollection.
         Which is a array like structure, but with it
         we cant use forEach(),map(),filter().
         With HTMLCollection we can only use simple for loop.
         So i also used simple for loop, but later converted,
         that HTMLCollection to a array using Array.from() method.
         Then i used map() over that new array and it works fine.
